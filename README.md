Bazapp Web Applications
=======================

Characters
==========

After purchasing a Duragadget children's keyboard I wanted a training application to teach my toddler how to use a keyboard - particularly since he has been using a touchscreen tablet device for a year and I'd like him to start learning to create content rather than just consume it. This application displays keys which are the same colour and font as on the Duragadget keyboard; the application keeps score of whether the correct key was pressed or not. New keys/characters are displayed weighted by performance, i.e. the poorer candidates are more likely to show. 

The first time I showed this to my son, he wanted to play "Letters and Press Button" instead of watching TV. 

The application supports showing just characters, numbers, or both and it supports 2 keyboard themes (Duragadget and Black keys). 

The release version (gh-pages branch) of the application can be viewed at:
